          It all started with a chance encounter at a coffee shop on a rainy Tuesday morning. 
          Anne was reading her favorite book while Ryan was struggling with his laptop at the next table. 
          When he accidentally knocked over his coffee, Anne offered her napkins with the warmest smile he'd ever seen.

        <p>
          Three years, countless adventures, and one perfect proposal later, we're ready to say "I do" 
          surrounded by the people we love most. Thank you for being part of our journey and for celebrating 
          this special day with us.
