      <div class="story-content fade-in">
        <p>We grew up just a few houses apart, sharing childhood dreams, scraped knees, and endless afternoons beneath the sun.</p><br>
        <p>Back then, we were simply two kids from the same neighborhood — building forts, chasing fireflies, and not yet knowing the kind of story we’d one day write together.</p><br>
        <p>As the years passed, life took us in different directions. We lost touch, moved forward, and let time carry us into separate chapters. But fate has a beautiful way of bringing hearts home. One unexpected afternoon, we bumped into each other — older, perhaps a little wiser, but still carrying the same spark we didn’t even know was there all along.</p><br>
        <p>That simple moment turned into coffee dates, long walks, laughter, and love. The friendship we once had quietly blossomed into something deeper, something lasting — something worth waiting for.</p><br>
        <p>Now, after all these years, we’re stepping into forever — hand in hand, heart to heart. We’re so grateful to have you with us as we begin this next chapter, surrounded by the people who’ve loved us through every season. Thank you for being part of our journey, and for celebrating this beautiful day with us.</p>
